                I'm excited to connect with you and share my passion for computer technology. With a genuine fascination for technology that has fueled me throughout my life, I am dedicated to finding a role where I can contribute my skills and mindset.
                <br><br>

                One of the aspects I find most enjoyable about programming is <b>the thrill of problem-solving</b>. There's something incredibly satisfying about encountering a challenging issue and then persevering until I find a solution and <b>overcome it</b>. It's during these moments that I experience a unique <b>sense of flow</b>, where time seems to stand still, and I become fully immersed in crafting solutions through programming.
                <br><br>              

                Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I hope we have the opportunity to collaborate and create something amazing together!

                Introducing <b>AutosaveNotepad</b>, my super handy text editor that's designed with peace of mind in mind. It's simple to use, and it took care of automatically saving my work as I went, so I'd never have to worry about losing my precious text. <b>AutosaveNotepad</b> won't ever tell you can't shut off your computer because there's a text file not saved somewhere!
                <br><br>

                You know what's cool? The interface is really intuitive, familiar and user-friendly, making writing on a fly a breeze. It even has this nifty Quicksave feature that lets you save files on the fly, directly to your own chosen default folder. Talk about convenience!
                <br><br>         

                <b>AutosaveNotepad</b> is like having a reliable, easy-to-use companion for your basic text editing needs.

                  A personal project I've been working on to learn SQL. It's a desktop application connected to a local database that allowed me to experiment and gain hands-on experience with SQL queries. <b>YourLocalHero</b> features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) with a user-friendly search box where you can input your queries effortlessly. 
                  <br><br>

                  <b>YourLocalHero</b> is a purely experimental project that has allowed me to dive into SQL and learn its intricacies firsthand. The near aim is to convert it into an environment simulating a hero-for-hire application, that is constantly interchanging the data in the database.
                  <br><br>
                  
                  With comprehensive search functionality, you can explore the database and retrieve the stats of heroes featured in one of the most popular rpg video game of all time. Additionally, for convenience, you can easily switch between admin and user modes by using the "--admin" or "--user" keywords in the search box. This feature allows you to explore different functionalities and access relevant features based on your needs.

                When I started learning to code, I needed a tool that would help me to grasp many concepts at the same time, and so the idea behind <b>ThemedPomodoro</b> was born. It's designed to enhance productivity and goal achievement through structured routines, while incorporating spaced repetition for effective learning and information retention.
                <br><br>

                <b>ThemedPomodoro</b> offered me a range of features to support my time management needs. You can customize the time intervals and working modes to suit your preferences, allowing for personalized productivity sessions. Additionally, the app allows for CRUD operations, empowering you to manage modes and profiles with ease. It also provides user settings for further customization and the ability to recall previous states, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted workflow.
                <br><br>

                With <b>ThemedPomodoro</b>, I could finally assign dedicated themes to each work-time block, bringing organization and systematization to my tasks and activities. This unique approach allowed me to stay focused and motivated while working towards my goals.

                Let me introduce you to certain <b>Suite of Productivity Scripts</b> that I'm really proud of! These scripts have been a game-changer for me, allowing me to streamline tasks and boost my productivity through automation.
                <br><br>
                One of my favorite scripts in this suite is <b>RightFoot</b>, and I came up with the name for this script because when using it, every boot up feels like a perfect start to a most productive day - just like you would get up from bed on the right foot and there was a warm coffee already waiting for you in the kitchen! Can't beat that!
                <br><br>
                It's incredibly versatile and works wonders during startup, saving a ton of time, especially when working in complicated environments. It's clickless, and yet it automates various tasks based on the day, time, or work mode. It's like having an all-in-one tool that takes care of everything, from launching apps to creating backups. I highly recommend giving this <b>Suite of Productivity Scripts</b> a try by custimising it into your own script tailored to your system. You won't be disappointed!

                This webpage you look at now is <b>the very first website I've ever written!</b>
                <br><br>

                I embarked on this project with a simple goal in mind: to <b>learn HTML, CSS, responsive design</b> and to sprinkle a bit of <b>JavaScript</b> on top, while writing code in <b>Visual Studio Code</b> environment. Little did I know that this quest would unveil a whole new world of creativity and satisfaction, and in no time I kept expanding my initial minimalist idea to achieve bold design solutions I wanted.
                <br><br>
                Coming up with the style and layout of the webpage turned out to be an unexpectedly gratifying, yet challenging experience. It allowed me to tap into my artistic side and explore the possibilities of visual expression, while also putting my video editing to use while creating the <b>cover video</b>. The overall style is inspired by my history with range of retro computers, including most notably <b>Atari XE, Commodore C64 and Amiga</b>.

                  The <b>Music Programmer</b> script is a creation born out of my deep passion for music. I wanted to automate the decision-making process of what to listen to and when to avoid option paralysis on a daily basis. 
                  <br><br>
                  During my work sessions, the music programmer script autoplays calming and focus-enhancing music. Once I'm done with work, the script auto switches gears and plays a curated playlists, signalling it's time to relax. On weekends or public holidays, it treats me to a special playlist comprised of live concerts. This adds an extra touch of excitement and enhances the feeling of celebration, as I'm a big fan of live music. During the Christmas period, it automatically plays calming wintery and Christmas-themed music, immersing whole household in the holiday spirit.
                  <br><br>
                  I believe this script has incredible potential, and I'm determined to transform it into a user-friendly application in due time. I want everyone to be able to enjoy the benefits of this script, regardless of their programming skills, which are somewhat required to tailor it to one's needs.
